# Azure SDK for Embedded C

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_apis/build/status/c/c%20-%20client%20-%20ci?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_build/latest?definitionId=722&branchName=master)

This repository contains official Embedded C libraries for Azure services.

## Getting started

To get started with a specific library, see the **README.md** file located in the library's project folder. You can find service libraries in the `/sdk` directory.

### Prerequisites
- CMake version 3.12 is required to use these libraries.

### Development Environment
Project contains files to work on Windows or Linux based OS.

> Note: Project contains git submodules required to build. Before building run `git submodule update --init --recursive`

#### Windows
Use PowerShell to run {projectDir}/build.ps1

> Note: Cmake will look for CURL within windows. Follow next steps to set up CURL using VCPKG:
<br> - Clone vcpgk: `git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git`
<br> - cd vcpkg (consider this path as PATH_TO_VCPKG)
<br> - .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
<br> - vcpkg.exe install --triplet x64-windows-static curl[winssl]
<br> - Add windows system variable: VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static
<br> - Add windows system variable: VCPKG_ROOT=[PATH_TO_VCPKG] (replace PATH_TO_VCPKG for where vcpkg is installed)

##### Visual Studio 2019
When following previous steps to set up CURL with VCPKG, open project folder with Visual Studio and everything will be ready to build and run tests.

#### Linux
- Install `openssl version 1.1.1`
  - For ubuntu: ```sudo apt-get install libssl-dev```
- Install `uuid`
  - ```sudo apt-get install uuid-dev```

##### steps to build
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```
> Note: use `cmake -Duse_default_uuid=ON ../` if no uuid-dev is installed in system

## Build Docs
Running below command from root folder will create a new folder `docs` containing html file with documentation about CORE headers.
> doxygen needs to be installed in the system
```
doxygen Doxyfile
```

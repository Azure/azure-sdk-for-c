This is a step-by-step guide of how to start from scratch and get the Azure SDK for Embedded C IoT Hub Samples running. 

Pre-requisites:
- [Having created an Azure account](https://github.com/ewertons/azure-sdk-for-c/wiki/How-to-create-an-Azure-account)
- [Having created an Azure IoT Hub](https://github.com/ewertons/azure-sdk-for-c/wiki/How-to-create-an-Azure-IoT-Hub)

What is covered:
- Downloading and building the Azure SDK for Embedded C suite
- Configuring and running the IoT Hub client samples.  

_Run on an Ubuntu Desktop 18.04 environment._

01. Install library dependencies

```
sudo apt-get install unzip git build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev
```

02. Install the latest cmake

Check the latest version available on https://cmake.org/download/.
Currently, the latest version of cmake is 3.17.2.

```shell
$ sudo apt-get purge cmake
$ wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.17.2/cmake-3.17.2.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf cmake-3.17.2.tar.gz 
$ cd cmake-3.17.2/
/cmake-3.17.2$ ./bootstrap 
/cmake-3.17.2$ sudo make install
```
Now we need to check if Cmake was correctly installed: 

```shell
cmake-3.17.2$ cmake --version
cmake version 3.17.2

CMake suite maintained and supported by Kitware (kitware.com/cmake).
/cmake-3.17.2$ 
```

03. Install Paho using vcpkg
 
The Azure IoT SDK for C uses Eclipse Paho for C installed via vcpkg (for the cmake integration).

```shell
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg
$ cd vcpkg/
/vcpkg$ ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh 
/vcpkg$ ./vcpkg install paho-mqtt
...
Total elapsed time: 2.835 min

The package paho-mqtt:x64-linux provides CMake targets:

    find_package(eclipse-paho-mqtt-c CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE eclipse-paho-mqtt-c::paho-mqtt3as-static eclipse-paho-mqtt-c::paho-mqtt3cs-static)

/vcpkg$
/vcpkg$ ./vcpkg integrate install
Applied user-wide integration for this vcpkg root.

CMake projects should use: "-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
```

04. Clone the Azure SDK for C

```shell
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-c
```

05. Generate a self-signed certificate

The Azure Embedded SDK for C IoT Client samples use a self-signed certificate.

A script is provided for creating that certificate. 

```shell
$ cd azure-sdk-for-c/sdk/iot/hub/samples/src
/azure-sdk-for-c/sdk/iot/hub/samples/src$ ./generate_certificate.sh 
```

rm: cannot remove 'device_cert_store.pem': No such file or directory

It is NOT recommended to use OpenSSL on Windows or OSX. Recommended TLS stacks are:
Microsoft Windows SChannel: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/schannel
OR
Apple Secure Transport : https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/secure_transport

If using OpenSSL, it is recommended to use the OpenSSL Trusted CA store configured on your system.
If required (for example on Windows), download the Baltimore PEM CA from https://www.digicert.com/digicert-root-certificates.htm to the current folder.
export AZ_IOT_DEVICE_X509_TRUST_PEM_FILE=/azure-sdk-for-c/sdk/iot/hub/samples/src/BaltimoreCyberTrustRoot.crt.pem

Sample certificate generated
Use the device_cert_store.pem file within the sample:
export AZ_IOT_DEVICE_X509_CERT_PEM_FILE=/azure-sdk-for-c/sdk/iot/hub/samples/src/device_cert_store.pem	

Use the following fingerprint when creating your device in IoT Hub (must remove colons):
SHA1 Fingerprint=C8DC8780C64FFBB5A66D8BC5D39D3C1BBB03FB69
/azure-sdk-for-c/sdk/iot/hub/samples/src$
```
</details>

Do not forget to set the environment variable above, making sure it maps to your local path.

```shell
$ export AZ_IOT_DEVICE_X509_CERT_PEM_FILE=/azure-sdk-for-c/sdk/iot/hub/samples/src/device_cert_store.pem
```

Save the certificate Fingerprint above (in this example, `C8DC8780C64FFBB5A66D8BC5D39D3C1BBB03FB69`).
It will be used to create the logical device on your Azure IoT Hub.


06. Create a logical device

- Log into your Azure account on [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
- On the menu on the left, click on "IoT devices" under "Explorers".
- Click on "New".
- Type an unique ID for your device.
- Select "X.509 Self-Signed" for "Authentication type". 
- Type the fingerprint obtained in the previous step (the same can be used for primary and secondary Thumbprints; no colons!).
- Click on "Save".

07. Collect information about Azure IoT Hub and device

    For the Azure IoT Embedded SDK for C samples, we will need the Azure IoT Hub name and device ID.

- Get the Azure IoT Hub FQDN.
    - On your Azure IoT Hub page, click on "Overview".
    - Copy and save the "Hostname" value (in this example, "myiothub.azure-devices.net").
- Get the device ID. 
  - On your Azure IoT Hub page, click on "IoT devices" under "Explorers".
  - On the list of devices, click on the device created on the previous step (in this example, "testdevice-x509").
  - Copy and save the "Device ID" value (in this example, "testdevice-x509"). 


08. Build the Azure SDK for C

Back into the folder where the Azure SDK for C was cloned...

```shell
/cd ~/azure-sdk-for-c/
/azure-sdk-for-c$ mkdir cmake
/azure-sdk-for-c$ cd cmake
/azure-sdk-for-c/cmake$ cmake -DTRANSPORT_PAHO=ON -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake ..
/azure-sdk-for-c/cmake$ make -j
```


09. Set the environment variables needed for the samples

According the the [readme documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/tree/master/sdk/iot/hub/samples) for the Azure Embedded SDK for C IoT client samples require the following environment variables.

```shell
export AZ_IOT_DEVICE_ID=<device ID obtained on step 7> 
export AZ_IOT_HUB_HOSTNAME=<FQDN obtained on step 7>
```

`AZ_IOT_DEVICE_X509_TRUST_PEM_FILE` is not required for all platforms (like Linux).

`AZ_IOT_DEVICE_X509_CERT_PEM_FILE` has already been set on step 5.

Using the values from the example above, the export command would look like this (don't run these command lines, you should use your own device ID and hostname)

```shell
$ export AZ_IOT_DEVICE_ID=testdevice-x509
$ export AZ_IOT_HUB_HOSTNAME=myiothub.azure-devices.net
```

10. Run the samples.

```shell
/azure-sdk-for-c/cmake$ cd sdk/iot/hub/samples
/azure-sdk-for-c/cmake/sdk/iot/hub/samples$ ll

**Telemetry (device-to-cloud messages)**

```shell
/azure-sdk-for-c/cmake/sdk/iot/hub/samples$ ./paho_iot_hub_telemetry_example 
X509 Certificate PEM Store File = /azure-sdk-for-c/sdk/iot/hub/samples/src/device_cert_store.pem
X509 Trusted PEM Store File = 
Device ID = testdevice-x509
IoT Hub Hostname = myiothub.azure-devices.net

```


**Cloud-to-Device (c2d) messages**

This sample requires two actions: 
- connecting the Azure IoT SDK device client to the hub, and 
- sending a c2d message through the Azure Portal.

First, run the sample:

```shell
/azure-sdk-for-c/cmake/sdk/iot/hub/samples$ ./paho_iot_hub_c2d_example 
X509 Certificate PEM Store File = /azure-sdk-for-c/sdk/iot/hub/samples/src/device_cert_store.pem
X509 Trusted PEM Store File = 
Device ID = testdevice-x509
IoT Hub Hostname = myiothub.azure-devices.net
Posting connect semaphore for client testdevice-x509 rc 0Subscribed to topics.
Waiting for activity. [Press ENTER to abort]

```

On the Azure Portal,
- Go to your Azure IoT hub page.
- Click on "IoT devices" under "Explorers".
- From the list of devices, click on your device (created on step 8).
  ![Device page](./resources/embc_samples_01_device.png)
- Click on "Message to Device".
- On "Message Body", type "Hello world!" (too cheesy? how about "Lorem Ipsum"?)
  ![Send message](./resources/embc_samples_02_c2d.png)
- Click on "Send Message".
  ![Success](./resources/embc_samples_03_c2d_success.png)

Back to the shell, verify that the message has been received by the sample:

```shell
/azure-sdk-for-c/cmake/sdk/iot/hub/samples$ ./paho_iot_hub_c2d_example 
X509 Certificate PEM Store File = /azure-sdk-for-c/sdk/iot/hub/samples/src/device_cert_store.pem
X509 Trusted PEM Store File = 
Device ID = testdevice-x509
IoT Hub Hostname = myiothub.azure-devices.net
Posting connect semaphore for client testdevice-x509 rc 0Subscribed to topics.
Waiting for activity. [Press ENTER to abort]
C2D Message arrived
Hello world!

Disconnected.
/azure-sdk-for-c/cmake/sdk/iot/hub/samples$
``` 

Note: the sample does not terminate automatically. In the output above Enter has been pressed.


**Direct Methods**

This sample requires two actions: connecting the Azure IoT SDK device client to the hub, and triggering the direct method through the Azure Portal.

First, run the sample:

```shell
/azure-sdk-for-c/cmake/sdk/iot/hub/samples$ ./paho_iot_hub_methods_example 
X509 Certificate PEM Store File = /azure-sdk-for-c/sdk/iot/hub/samples/src/device_cert_store.pem
X509 Trusted PEM Store File = 
Device ID = testdevice-x509
IoT Hub Hostname = myiothub.azure-devices.net
Posting connect semaphore for client testdevice-x509 rc 0Subscribed to topics.
Waiting for activity. [Press ENTER to abort]

```

On the Azure Portal,
- Go to your Azure IoT hub page.
- Click on "IoT devices" under "Explorers".
- From the list of devices, click on your device (created on step Z).
- Click on "Direct Method".
  ![Methods](./resources/embc_samples_04_methods.png)
- On "Method Name", type "ping" (the sample expects the name "ping").
- On "Payload", type '{ "somevalue": 1234 }' (the payload can be empty, but MUST be a valid Json).
- Click on "Invoke Method".
- See the reply from the sample on "Result" (bottom of the page).
  ![Response](./resources/embc_samples_05_methods_response.png)


Back to the shell, verify that the message has been received by the sample:

```shell
/azure-sdk-for-c/cmake/sdk/iot/hub/samples$ ./paho_iot_hub_methods_example 
X509 Certificate PEM Store File = /azure-sdk-for-c/sdk/iot/hub/samples/src/device_cert_store.pem
X509 Trusted PEM Store File = 
Device ID = testdevice-x509
IoT Hub Hostname = myiothub.azure-devices.net
Posting connect semaphore for client testdevice-x509 rc 0Subscribed to topics.
Waiting for activity. [Press ENTER to abort]

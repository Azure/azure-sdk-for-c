## Examples

### Telemetry

Telemetry functionality can be achieved by sending a user payload to a specific topic. In order to get the appropriate topic to which to send, use the `az_iot_hub_client_telemetry_publish_topic_get()` API. An example use case is below.

```C
static az_iot_hub_client my_client;
static az_span my_iothub_hostname = AZ_SPAN_LITERAL_FROM_STR("constoso.azure-devices.net");
static az_span my_device_id = AZ_SPAN_LITERAL_FROM_STR("contoso_device");

void my_telemetry_func()
{
  //Initialize the client to then pass to the telemetry API
  az_iot_hub_client_init(&my_client, my_iothub_hostname, my_device_id, NULL);

  //Allocate a span with capacity large enough to put the telemetry topic.
  //Optionally, the size can include space for a null terminator.
  //Here, the buffer is zero initialized to null terminate the topic.
  uint8_t telemetry_topic_buffer[64] = { 0 };
  az_span topic_span = AZ_SPAN_FROM_BUFFER(telemetry_topic_buffer);

  //Get the NULL terminated topic and put in topic_span to send the telemetry
  az_iot_hub_client_telemetry_publish_topic_get(&client, NULL, topic_span, &topic_span);
}
```

### IoT Hub Client

To use IoT Hub connectivity, the first action by a developer should be to initialize the
client with the `az_iot_hub_client_init()` API. Once that is initialized, you may use the
`az_iot_hub_client_user_name_get()` and `az_iot_hub_client_client_id_get()` to get the
user name and client id to establish a connection with IoT Hub.

An example use case is below.

```C
//FOR SIMPLICITY THIS DOES NOT HAVE ERROR CHECKING. IN PRODUCTION ENSURE PROPER ERROR CHECKING.

az_iot_hub_client my_client;
static az_span my_iothub_hostname = AZ_SPAN_LITERAL_FROM_STR("constoso.azure-devices.net");
static az_span my_device_id = AZ_SPAN_LITERAL_FROM_STR("contoso_device");

//Make sure to size the buffer to fit the user name (100 is an example)
static uint8_t my_mqtt_user_name_buffer[100];
static az_span my_mqtt_user_name = AZ_SPAN_LITERAL_FROM_BUFFER(my_mqtt_user_name_buffer);

//Make sure to size the buffer to fit the client id (16 is an example)
static uint8_t my_mqtt_client_id_buffer[16];
static az_span my_mqtt_client_id = AZ_SPAN_LITERAL_FROM_BUFFER(my_mqtt_client_id_buffer);

int main()
{
  //Get the default IoT Hub options
  az_iot_hub_client_options options = az_iot_hub_client_options_default();

  //Initialize the client with hostname, device id, and options
  az_iot_hub_client_init(&my_client, my_iothub_hostname, my_device_id, &options);

  //Get the MQTT user name to connect
  az_iot_hub_client_user_name_get(&my_client, my_mqtt_user_name, &my_mqtt_user_name)

  //Get the MQTT client id to connect
  az_iot_hub_client_client_id_get(&my_client, my_mqtt_client_id, &my_mqtt_client_id);

  //At this point you are free to use my_mqtt_client_id and my_mqtt_user_name to connect using
  //your MQTT client.
}
```

### Properties

Included in the IoT SDK are helper functions to form and manage properties for IoT Hub services. Implementation starts by using the `az_iot_hub_client_properties_init()` API. The user is free to intitialize using an empty, but appropriately sized, span to later append properties or an already populated span containing a properly formated property buffer. "Properly formatted" properties follow the form `{key}={value}&{key}={value}`.

Below is an example use case of appending properties.

```C
//FOR SIMPLICITY THIS DOES NOT HAVE ERROR CHECKING. IN PRODUCTION ENSURE PROPER ERROR CHECKING.
void my_property_func()
{
  //Allocate a span to put the properties
  uint8_t property_buffer[64];
  az_span property_span = az_span_init(property_buffer, 0, sizeof(property_buffer));
  
  //Initialize the property struct with the span
  az_iot_hub_client_properties props;
  az_iot_hub_client_properties_init(&props, property_span);
  //Append properties
  az_iot_hub_client_properties_append(&props, AZ_SPAN_FROM_STR("key"), AZ_SPAN_FROM_STR("value"));
  //At this point, you are able to pass the `props` to other API's with property parameters.
}
```

Below is an example use case of initializing an already populated property span.

```C
//FOR SIMPLICITY THIS DOES NOT HAVE ERROR CHECKING. IN PRODUCTION ENSURE PROPER ERROR CHECKING.
static az_span my_prop_span = AZ_SPAN_LITERAL_FROM_STR("my_device=contoso&my_key=my_value");
void my_property_func()
{
  //Initialize the property struct with the span
  az_iot_hub_client_properties props;
  az_iot_hub_client_properties_init(&props, my_prop_span);
  //At this point, you are able to pass the `props` to other API's with property parameters.
}
```

### Telemetry

Telemetry functionality can be achieved by sending a user payload to a specific topic. In order to get the appropriate topic to which to send, use the `az_iot_hub_client_telemetry_publish_topic_get()` API. An example use case is below.

```C
//FOR SIMPLICITY THIS DOES NOT HAVE ERROR CHECKING. IN PRODUCTION ENSURE PROPER ERROR CHECKING.

static az_iot_hub_client my_client;
static az_span my_iothub_hostname = AZ_SPAN_LITERAL_FROM_STR("constoso.azure-devices.net");
static az_span my_device_id = AZ_SPAN_LITERAL_FROM_STR("contoso_device");

void my_telemetry_func()
{
  //Initialize the client to then pass to the telemetry API
  az_iot_hub_client_init(&my_client, my_iothub_hostname, my_device_id, NULL);

  //Allocate a span with capacity large enough to put the telemetry topic.
  //Optionally, the size can include space for a null terminator.
  //Here, the buffer is zero initialized to null terminate the topic.
  uint8_t telemetry_topic_buffer[64] = { 0 };
  az_span topic_span = az_span_init(telemetry_topic_buffer, 0,
                sizeof(telemetry_topic_buffer) / sizeof(telemetry_topic_buffer[0]));

  //Get the NULL terminated topic and put in topic_span to send the telemetry
  az_iot_hub_client_telemetry_publish_topic_get(&my_client, NULL, topic_span, &topic_span);
}
```

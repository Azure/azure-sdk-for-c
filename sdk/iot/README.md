# Azure IoT Clients

Azure SDK for Embedded C official IoT Hub client library.

## Getting Started

- **Docs**: If you're new to the Azure SDK for Embedded C take a look at the [State Machine diagram](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/master/sdk/iot/doc/mqtt_state_machine.md) that explains the high-level architecture, SDK components, and a clear view of SDK x Application responsibilities. 

- **Build**: The Azure IoT library is compiled following the same steps listed on the root [README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/master/README.md) documentation, under ["Getting Started Using the SDK"](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/master/README.md#getting-started-using-the-sdk). 

- **Samples**: [This page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/tree/master/sdk/iot/hub/samples) explains samples for the Azure Embedded C SDK IoT Hub Client and [this page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/tree/master/sdk/iot/provisioning/samples) shows the Provisioning Clients and how to use them.

  For a step-by-step guide starting from scratch, you may refer to [this documentation](./doc/how_to_iot_hub_samples.md).

### Prerequisites

For compiling the Azure SDK for Embedded C for the most common platforms (Windows and Linux), no further prerequisites are necessary.
Please follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](#Getting-Started) section above.
For compiling for specific target devices, please refer to their specific toolchain documentation. 

## Key Features

Feature | Azure SDK for Embedded C | Description
---------|----------|---------------------
 [Send device-to-cloud message](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-d2c) | :heavy_check_mark: | Send device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub with the option to add custom message properties. 
 [Receive cloud-to-device messages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-c2d) | :heavy_check_mark: | Receive cloud-to-device messages and associated properties from IoT Hub.   
 [Device Twins](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins) | :heavy_check_mark: | IoT Hub persists a device twin for each device that you connect to IoT Hub.  The device can perform operations like get twin document, subscribe to desired property updates.
 [Direct Methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-direct-methods) | :heavy_check_mark: | IoT Hub gives you the ability to invoke direct methods on devices from the cloud.  
 [DPS - Device Provisioning Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-dps/) | :heavy_check_mark: | This SDK supports connecting your device to the Device Provisioning Service via, for example, [individual enrollment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-dps/concepts-service#enrollment) using an [X.509 leaf certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-dps/concepts-security#leaf-certificate).  
 Protocol | MQTT | The Azure SDK for Embedded C supports only MQTT.  
 Retry Policies | :heavy_check_mark:* | The Azure SDK for Embedded C provides guidelines for retries, but actual retries should be handled by the application.
 [Plug and Play](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-pnp/overview-iot-plug-and-play) | :heavy_multiplication_x: | IoT Plug and Play Preview enables solution developers to integrate devices with their solutions without writing any embedded code. 




## Examples

### IoT Hub Client

To use IoT Hub connectivity, the first action by a developer should be to initialize the
client with the `az_iot_hub_client_init()` API. Once that is initialized, you may use the
`az_iot_hub_client_get_user_name()` and `az_iot_hub_client_get_client_id()` to get the
user name and client id to establish a connection with IoT Hub.

An example use case is below.

```C
//FOR SIMPLICITY THIS DOES NOT HAVE ERROR CHECKING. IN PRODUCTION ENSURE PROPER ERROR CHECKING.

az_iot_hub_client my_client;
static az_span my_iothub_hostname = AZ_SPAN_LITERAL_FROM_STR("constoso.azure-devices.net");
static az_span my_device_id = AZ_SPAN_LITERAL_FROM_STR("contoso_device");

//Make sure to size the buffer to fit the user name (100 is an example)
static char my_mqtt_user_name[100];
static size_t my_mqtt_user_name_length;

//Make sure to size the buffer to fit the client id (16 is an example)
static char my_mqtt_client_id_buffer[16];
static size_t my_mqtt_client_id_length;

int main()
{
  //Get the default IoT Hub options
  az_iot_hub_client_options options = az_iot_hub_client_options_default();

  //Initialize the client with hostname, device id, and options
  az_iot_hub_client_init(&my_client, my_iothub_hostname, my_device_id, &options);

  //Get the MQTT user name to connect
  az_iot_hub_client_get_user_name(&my_client, my_mqtt_user_name, 
                sizeof(my_mqtt_user_name), &my_mqtt_user_name_length);

  //Get the MQTT client id to connect
  az_iot_hub_client_get_client_id(&my_client, my_mqtt_client_id, 
                sizeof(my_mqtt_client_id), &my_mqtt_client_id_length);

  //At this point you are free to use my_mqtt_client_id and my_mqtt_user_name to connect using
  //your MQTT client.
}
```

### Properties

Included in the Azure SDK for Embedded C are helper functions to form and manage properties for IoT Hub services. Implementation starts by using the `az_iot_hub_client_properties_init()` API. The user is free to intitialize using an empty, but appropriately sized, span to later append properties or an already populated span containing a properly formated property buffer. "Properly formatted" properties follow the form `{key}={value}&{key}={value}`.

Below is an example use case of appending properties.

```C
//FOR SIMPLICITY THIS DOES NOT HAVE ERROR CHECKING. IN PRODUCTION ENSURE PROPER ERROR CHECKING.
void my_property_func()
{
  //Allocate a span to put the properties
  uint8_t property_buffer[64];
  az_span property_span = az_span_init(property_buffer, sizeof(property_buffer));
  
  //Initialize the property struct with the span
  az_iot_hub_client_properties props;
  az_iot_hub_client_properties_init(&props, property_span, 0);
  //Append properties
  az_iot_hub_client_properties_append(&props, AZ_SPAN_FROM_STR("key"), AZ_SPAN_FROM_STR("value"));
  //At this point, you are able to pass the `props` to other API's with property parameters.
}
```

Below is an example use case of initializing an already populated property span.

```C
//FOR SIMPLICITY THIS DOES NOT HAVE ERROR CHECKING. IN PRODUCTION ENSURE PROPER ERROR CHECKING.
static az_span my_prop_span = AZ_SPAN_LITERAL_FROM_STR("my_device=contoso&my_key=my_value");
void my_property_func()
{
  //Initialize the property struct with the span
  az_iot_hub_client_properties props;
  az_iot_hub_client_properties_init(&props, my_prop_span, az_span_size(my_prop_span));
  //At this point, you are able to pass the `props` to other API's with property parameters.
}
```

### Telemetry

Telemetry functionality can be achieved by sending a user payload to a specific topic. In order to get the appropriate topic to which to send, use the `az_iot_hub_client_telemetry_get_publish_topic()` API. An example use case is below.

```C
//FOR SIMPLICITY THIS DOES NOT HAVE ERROR CHECKING. IN PRODUCTION ENSURE PROPER ERROR CHECKING.

static az_iot_hub_client my_client;
static az_span my_iothub_hostname = AZ_SPAN_LITERAL_FROM_STR("constoso.azure-devices.net");
static az_span my_device_id = AZ_SPAN_LITERAL_FROM_STR("contoso_device");

void my_telemetry_func()
{
  //Initialize the client to then pass to the telemetry API
  az_iot_hub_client_init(&my_client, my_iothub_hostname, my_device_id, NULL);

  //Allocate a char buffer with capacity large enough to put the telemetry topic.
  char telemetry_topic[64];
  size_t telemetry_topic_length;

  //Get the NULL terminated topic and put in telemetry_topic to send the telemetry
  az_iot_hub_client_telemetry_get_publish_topic(&my_client, NULL, telemetry_topic, 
                                    sizeof(telemetry_topic), &telemetry_topic_length);
}
```

# Azure SDK Storage Blobs Library for Embedded C

Azure Blob Storage library (`az_storage_blobs`) provides abstractions, and helpers for communicating with Azure Storage Blobs in the C programming language. This library follows the Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Embedded C.

The Azure SDK Storage Blobs Library for Embedded C can be used for the following actions:

* Upload blobs
* Download blobs

## Getting Started

The Azure Storage Blobs Client library facilitates connectivity to the Azure Storage Blobs service. Since this service uses HTTP, you must plug in an HTTP adapter capable of sending the HTTP request to your device's HTTP stack. For information on how to do this, please see [this page][docs_platform_readme].

### Authentication

The embedded C SDK currently supports SAS based storage authentication.  See [this page][storage_access_control_sas] for information on creating SAS tokens.
The client credential should be set to `AZ_CREDENTIAL_ANONYMOUS` when using SAS tokens.

### Docs

For API documentation, please see the doxygen generated docs [here][azure_sdk_for_c_doxygen_docs]. You can find the Storage Blobs specific docs by navigating to the **Files -> File List** section near the top and choosing any of the header files prefixed with `az_storage_blobs`.

### Build

The Azure Storage Blobs library is compiled following the same steps listed on the root [README][azure_sdk_for_c_readme] documentation, under ["Getting Started Using the SDK"][azure_sdk_for_c_readme_getting_started].

The library targets made available via CMake are the following:

- `az::storage::blobs` - For Azure Storage Blobs features ([API documentation here][azure_sdk_for_c_doxygen_docs])

### Prerequisites

For compiling the Azure SDK for Embedded C for the most common platforms (Windows and Linux), no further prerequisites are necessary.
Please follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section above.
For compiling for specific target devices, please refer to their specific toolchain documentation.

## Key Concepts

### Creating the Storage Client

To use the storage client, the first action is to initialize the client with `az_storage_blobs_blob_client_init`.
```C
  az_storage_blobs_blob_client client;
  az_storage_blobs_blob_client_options options = az_storage_blobs_blob_client_options_default();

  az_storage_blobs_blob_client_init(
          &client, az_span_from_str(getenv(URI_ENV)), AZ_CREDENTIAL_ANONYMOUS, &options);
```

### Uploading a blob

Once the client is created it can be used to upload blobs.
```C
  az_result const blob_upload_result = az_storage_blobs_blob_upload(
      &client, NULL, content_to_upload, NULL, &http_response)
```

### Downloading a blob

Once the client is created it can be used to download blobs.
```C
  az_result const blob_download_result = az_storage_blobs_blob_download(
      &client, NULL, NULL, &http_response)
```

### Retry Policy

While working with Storage, you might encounter transient failures caused by [rate limits][storage_rate_limits] enforced by the service, or other transient problems like network outages. For information about handling these types of failures, see [Retry pattern][azure_pattern_retry] in the Cloud Design Patterns guide, and the related [Circuit Breaker pattern][azure_pattern_circuit_breaker].

## Examples

This [page][samples_storage_blobs_readme] explains samples for the Azure Embedded C SDK Storage Blobs Client.

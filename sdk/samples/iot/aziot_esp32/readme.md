# How to Setup and Run Azure SDK for Embedded C IoT Hub Client on Espressif ESP32

## Introduction

This is a "to-the-point" guide outlining how to run an Azure SDK for Embedded C IoT Hub telemetry sample on an ESP32 microcontroller.

This sample is based on the Arduino IDE and with the release of the new **Arduino library for Azure IoT**, this sample was moved to that repo: [ESP32 Sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c-arduino/blob/main/examples/Azure_IoT_Hub_ESP32/readme.md).

Check [aka.ms/arduino](https://aka.ms/arduino) for this and other Arduino based samples.

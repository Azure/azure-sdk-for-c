# Azure IoT Device Provisioning Service Sample

## Introduction
This document explains samples for the Azure Embedded C SDK IoT Device Provisioning Client and how to use them.

Samples are designed to highlight the function calls required to connect with the Device Provisioning Service (DPS). These calls illustrate the happy path of the [mqtt state machine](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/master/sdk/docs/iot/mqtt_state_machine.md). As a result,  **these samples are NOT designed to be used as production-level code**. Production code needs to incorporate other elements, such as connection retries and more extensive error-handling, which these samples do not include.  These samples also utilizes OpenSSL, which is **NOT recommended to use in production code on Windows or macOS**.

The samples' instructions include specifics for both Windows and Linux based systems.  For Windows, the command line examples are based on the Command Prompt and not PowerShell.  The Linux examples are tailored to Debian/Ubuntu environments.  Samples are also designed to work on macOS systems, but the instructions do not yet include specific command line examples for this environment.

## Key Concepts

Further background on the Azure IoT Client library and key concepts are explained in detail in the [Azure IoT Client README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/tree/master/sdk/docs/iot#azure-iot-clients).

## Prerequisites

* Have an [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) created.
* Have an [Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal) created.
* Have an [Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/quick-setup-auto-provision) created.
* Have [git](https://git-scm.com/download) installed.
* Have [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/source/) installed:
  * For Linux based systems, we recommend:
	 ```bash
	  sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
	```
  * For non-Linux based systems, download the [OpenSSL 1.1.1 LTS](https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.1g.tar.gz) command line utility and follow the downloaded INSTALL document.
* Have the following build setup:
	* For Linux based systems, have make installed:
	  ```bash
	  sudo apt-get install build-essential
	  ```
	 * For Windows systems, have [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) installed.
	 * For all systems, have the latest version of [CMake](https://cmake.org/download) installed.
* Have Microsoft [VCPKG](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) package manager and [Eclipse Paho MQTT C client](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/) installed.  Use the directions [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c#development-environment) to download VCPKG and install Paho MQTT.

## Getting Started

All samples require either x509 certification or SAS symmetric key authentication to connect to Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS).  To easily run this sample, we have provided a script to generate a self-signed device certification used for device authentication.  Three different `.pem` files will be produced.  **This script is intended for sample use only and not to be used in production code**.
1. Enter the directory `/azure-sdk-for-c/sdk/samples/iot/provisioning/src/` and run the script using the following form:

    Linux:
    ```bash
    ./generate_certificate.sh
    ```
    Windows:
    ```cmd
    generate_certificate.cmd
    ```

2. For Windows (or if required on your OS), set the environment variable `AZ_IOT_DEVICE_X509_TRUST_PEM_FILE` to the path of the BaltimoreCyberTrustRoot.crt.pem file noted near the bottom of the output. You must [download this pem file](https://cacerts.digicert.com/BaltimoreCyberTrustRoot.crt.pem) and store it in the location specified by that filepath.

3. The remaining output will be used in the next steps.
### #Paho IoT Provisioning (Certificates)
**Executable:** paho_iot_provisioning_sample

This [sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/master/sdk/samples/iot/provisioning/src/paho_iot_provisioning_example.c) uses x509 authentication to connect to Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS).
1. Set the environment variable `AZ_IOT_DEVICE_X509_CERT_PEM_FILE` to the path of the generated .pem file noted at the bottom of the output.

2. In your Azure DPS, add a new individual device enrollment using the recently generated `device_ec_cert.pem` file.  See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/quick-create-simulated-device-x509#create-a-device-enrollment-entry-in-the-portal) for further instruction.  After creation, the Registration ID of your device should appear as `paho-sample-device1` in the Individual Enrollments tab.

### Paho IoT Provisioning (SAS)
**Executable:** paho_iot_provisioning_sas_sample

This [sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c/blob/master/sdk/samples/iot/provisioning/src/paho_iot_provisioning_sas_example.c) uses SAS symmetric key authentication to connect to Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS).

* In your Azure DPS, add a new individual device enrollment using SAS. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/quick-create-simulated-device-symm-key#create-a-device-enrollment-entry-in-the-portal) for further instruction, with one exception--for the Primary Key, **you must use** the fingerprint noted in the output.  **Do NOT use** the *Auto-generate keys* option. After creation, the Registration ID of your device will appear in the Individual Enrollments tab.

## Build and Run the Sample

1. Set the remaining environment variables.  Setting a variable will take the following form:

	  Linux:
	  ```bash
	  export ENV_VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE
	  ```
	  Windows:
	  ```cmd
	  set "ENV_VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE"
	  ```
	#### Paho IoT Provisioning (Certificates)
  * `VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET` and `VCPKG_ROOT`: These should already be set per these [directions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c#development-environment).
  * `AZ_IOT_DEVICE_X509_CERT_PEM_FILE`: This should already be set per directions above.
  * `AZ_IOT_ID_SCOPE`: Copy this value from the Overview tab in your Azure DPS.
  * `AZ_IOT_REGISTRATION_ID`: This should be `paho-sample-device1`.
	#### Paho IoT Provisioning (SAS)
  * `VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET` and `VCPKG_ROOT`: These should already be set per these [directions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-c#development-environment).
  * `AZ_IOT_PROVISIONING_SAS_KEY`: Select your enrolled device from the Individual Enrollments tab and copy its Primary Key.
  * `AZ_IOT_ID_SCOPE`: Copy this value from the Overview tab in your Azure DPS.
  * `AZ_IOT_REGISTRATION_ID_SAS`: Copy the Registration Id of your SAS device from the Individual Enrollments tab.

2. Compile the code:
  * Enter the directory `/azure-sdk-for-c/cmake`.  If it does not exist, please create it.
  * Build the directory structure and the samples:

    ```bash
    cmake -DTRANSPORT_PAHO=ON ..
    cmake --build .
    ```
3. From within the cmake directory, run the sample:

    Linux:
    ```bash
    ./sdk/samples/iot/provisioning/<sample executable here>
    ```
    Windows:
    ```cmd
    az.sln
    ```
	Once the Windows solution opens in Visual Studio:
    * Navigate on the Solution Explorer panel to the sample project you would like to run.
    * Make it the default startup project (right-click on the sample project, then click on Set as Startup Project).
    * Build and run the project (F5 on most installations).

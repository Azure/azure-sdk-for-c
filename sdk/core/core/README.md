# Azure SDK Core Library for C

Azure Core library for C (`az_core`) provides shared primitives, abstractions, and helpers for modern Azure SDK client libraries written in the C programming language. These libraries follow the Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Embedded C.

The library allows client libraries to expose common functionality in a consistent fashion.  Once you learn how to use these APIs in one client library, you will know how to use them in other client libraries.

## Key concepts

### Error Structure

Defined in [inc/az_result.h](inc/az_result.h).

```c
// az_core.h
enum {
  AZ_OK              =          0,
  AZ_ERROR_FLAG      = 0x80000000,

  AZ_CORE_FACILITY   =    0x10000,
};

typedef int32_t az_result;

#define AZ_MAKE_ERROR(facility, code) ((az_result)(0x80000000 | ((uint32_t)(facility) << 16)) | (uint32_t)(code))

#define AZ_MAKE_RESULT(facility, code) ((az_result)(((uint32_t)(facility) << 16)) | (uint32_t)(code))

inline bool az_failed(az_result result) {
  return (result & AZ_ERROR_FLAG) != 0;
}

inline bool az_succeeded(az_result result) {
  return (result & AZ_ERROR_FLAG) == 0;
}
```

Additional information could be passed using output parameters.

### Span of bytes

Defined in [inc/az_span.h](inc/az_span.h).

```c
typedef struct {
  struct {
    uint8_t * ptr;
    int32_t length;
    int32_t capacity;
  } _internal;
} az_span;
```

### Strings

A string is a span of UTF-8 characters. It's not a zero-terminated string. Defined in [inc/az_span.h](inc/az_span.h).

```c
az_span hello_world = AZ_SPAN_FROM_STR("Hello world!");
```

## Examples

### az_log.h
The various components of the SDK are broken up into "classifications". Log messages are filtered with these classification enums so that the user can decide which log messages they want. Classifications are derived from higher level groupings called "facilities". At the beginning of the user's code, they can initialize the logging by optionally setting the classifications they want, setting their logging listener, and then logging any messages they desire. 

*Basic Code Snippet*

Relevant components for logging are located in [az_result.h](./inc/az_result.h) and [az_log.h](./inc/az_log.h). The `az_log_classification` enum will be used to choose features to log.

```c
/* az_result.h */
enum
{
  _az_FACILITY_CORE = 0x1,
  _az_FACILITY_PLATFORM = 0x2,
  _az_FACILITY_JSON = 0x3,
  _az_FACILITY_HTTP = 0x4,
  _az_FACILITY_MQTT = 0x5,
  _az_FACILITY_IOT = 0x6,
  _az_FACILITY_STD = 0x7FFF,
};

/* az_log.h */
typedef enum {
  AZ_LOG_HTTP_REQUEST  = _az_LOG_MAKE_CLASSIFICATION(_az_FACILITY_HTTP, 1),
  AZ_LOG_HTTP_RESPONSE = _az_LOG_MAKE_CLASSIFICATION(_az_FACILITY_HTTP, 2),
} az_log_classification;
```

Here is an example of what basic sdk and user code might look like working together.
The user needs to do two things as exemplified below:
1. Set the classifications you wish to log.
2. Set your logging function that follows the `az_log_message_fn` prototype. In this case, the logging function uses a basic `printf()`.

```c
/* INTERNAL sdk http code */
static az_span test_log_message = AZ_SPAN_LITERAL_FROM_STR("HTTP Request Success");

void some_http_request_code()
{
  /* Some http code */
  az_log_write(AZ_LOG_HTTP_REQUEST, test_log_message);
}


/* User Application Code */
az_log_classification const classifications[] = { AZ_LOG_HTTP_REQUEST, AZ_LOG_HTTP_RESPONSE, AZ_LOG_END_OF_LIST };

void test_log_func(az_log_classification classification, az_span message)
{
    printf("%.*s\n", az_span_length(message), az_span_ptr(message));
}

int main()
{
  az_log_set_classifications(classifications);
  az_log_set_callback(&test_log_func);

  some_http_request_code();
}
```

Here the classifications are set to `AZ_LOG_HTTP_REQUEST` and `AZ_LOG_HTTP_RESPONSE`. Should the `AZ_LOG_HTTP_REQUEST` be omitted from the set of classifications, the log message in `some_http_request_code()` will not be logged.

If no classifications are set then all messages are logged.
